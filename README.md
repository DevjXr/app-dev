## My favorite series: DARK

Why Dark stands out
-Intricate Storytelling: The series is a masterclass in weaving complex timelines, where every detail connects.
-Philosophical Depth: It delves into themes of determinism, free will, and the existence of parallel worlds.
-Stunning Cinematography: Winden's eerie atmosphere is enhanced by haunting visuals and a moody color palette.
